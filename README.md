# 🚀 My First Python Program 👩🏻‍💻

Welcome! This is the very first Python code I wrote while starting my learning journey 🌱  
I’m exploring how to work with strings, variables, and basic built-in functions in Python.

---

## 🧠 What I Practiced:
- Creating variables
- String concatenation
- String functions like `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.index()`
- Printing formatted output

---

## 💻 My Code:

```python
character_name = "Tom"
character_age = 20
print("There was a boy named " + character_name)

phrase = "Giraffe Academy"
print(phrase.upper())
print(phrase.isupper())
print(phrase.lower())
print("Giraffe\nAcademy")
print(phrase + " is cool")
print(phrase.index("Academy"))
print(phrase[0])

---

🖥️ Output:

There was a boy named Tom
GIRAFFE ACADEMY
False
giraffe academy
Giraffe
Academy
Giraffe Academy is cool
8
G

📌 Notes:

Just one step at a time toward building my skills in programming 💪
